# Lab 9: Deployment

Now we will deploy our small website to Netlify.

## Register Netlify Account

You will have to create an account on netlify.com.

## Version Control

Netlify works by connecting with a public Git repository. Create a Git repository on github.com, gitlab.com or bitbucket.com and push your files:
```
cd mysite
git init
git remote add origin [git clone url]
git add .
git commit "Initial Commit"
git push
```

## Create a new site on Netlify

Login to netlify.com and click "New site from Git".
